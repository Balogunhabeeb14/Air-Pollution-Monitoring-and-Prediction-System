# AirPot

Airpot Project is aimed at air pollution concentration prediction.

The air pollution concentration is sourced from IoT emission sensors installed across different locations in the UK.

As discovered from the literatures, most pollutants particularly NOx are from vehicle exhausts, making traffic information a major feature to be looked into.

Aside the traffic, other data have been discovered to be influential, example is the weather data, and environmental data.

So, the project data used four kinds of data which was all merge together using co-ordinates (longitude and latitudes) as key.
We collect air pollution concentration from a sensor installed in a particular position, then using the co-ordinate of the place the sensor was installed,
we collect weather, traffic and environmental data for same or close to the point the sensor was installed.


This same process was done for all publicly available sensors installed within UK.

We then implmented different ML and AI models to predict/forecast the different Pollution concentration.
